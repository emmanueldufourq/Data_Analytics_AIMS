## Individual Assignment (this will be graded)

The assignment is broken up into 4 parts: 3 programming exercises and 1 set of theory questions. 

Provide as much detail as you can and add comments such that the notebooks you create are easy to follow. Remember to use a GPU instance when working on the CNN exercise. The exercises here are very similar to what you have been taught. Look at the class examples and my example solutions, don't copy paste code, but rather try and understand what you are doing. Ask yourself why you are doing something, what is the goal, what are you trying to acheive using each line of code. It becomes very clear when someone has put a lot of effort into their solution - I am hoping you will put effort into your solutions. Think about the connection between theory and code.

For the coding tasks, share your notebook with me when you are done. To do this, click on the share button at the top right and add my email: dufourq@aims.ac.za **Please name your notebooks accordingly as described in each notebook's notes.** To rename your notebook, you can do this at the top left of the page where it ends with _.ipynb_ If you have a problem renaming the notebook, then just make sure you add your full name to the notebook.
